# Em2
The "Em2" controller, also nicknamed Springspinne, is a hand-held all-button game controller based on the Em controller with a focus on being more compact and easier to build. It's running the amazing [GP2040-CE](https://gp2040-ce.info/) firmware.

![Picture of the Em2 from the top. It has two buttons on the top
left, two buttons on the top right, and three smaller menu buttons in a cluster in the middle. It is 3D printed in a red color with white hexagonal buttons.
A USB-C cable is connected to the controller.](pictures/em2-top-view.jpg "The Em2")

The idea is that most of the buttons are on the bottom side of the controller
and you can press them with your various fingers. The design aims to let you
use the same fingers for the same buttons you would use on more traditional
leverless controllers.

![Picture of the Em's bottom. It is 3D printed in red PLA. On that surface, there are
ten white, hexagonal buttons. From this perspective there are seven buttons on the left
and three buttons on the right. The left buttons are clustered similar to
sideways arcade buttons with an additional button on the top. The right buttons are arranged in a staggered line](pictures/em2-bottom-view.jpg "The business end of
the Em2")

<!-- This is the button layout I am using:

## Why this form factor?
The idea is to have something more like a game pad and the ability to laze
around on the couch while also having the benefits of a leverless controller.
Like a flatbox without having to have the controller on the lap. While you
could just use a gamepad for this purpose, I have been unhappy with most, if
not all, dpads and wanted to be able to not miss the benefits of more detailed
control of directional input.

<!--## How can I get my own?
**Note:** I'm still working on refining the details of version 1.0. Some
aspects might not be completely final

This repository contains all information you need to print and assemble your
own.

The current version of this controller is handwired, so some soldering
equipment and skill is required.

### What you'll need
- 4x printed modular button caps 4.9mm high for the top (based on [Stokken's great Kailh
  Choc V1 button
  caps](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/kailh-choc-v1-modular-keycaps))
- 11x printed modular button caps 5.4mm high for the bottom(also Stokken's design)
- 15x printed button cap stems (from [Stokken's great Kailh
  Choc V1 button
  caps](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/kailh-choc-v1-modular-keycaps))
- 15x Kailh Choc v1 Switches (I use
  5x [nocturnal](https://keycapsss.com/switchestester/switches/272/ambients-silent-choc-switches-lowprokb-kailh-choc-v1)
  and 10x
  [Twilight](https://keycapsss.com/switchestester/switches/272/ambients-silent-choc-switches-lowprokb-kailh-choc-v1?number=KC10221_TWI)
  but any others like pink or reds will work)

or

- 4x printed button caps V2 top
- 11x printed button caps V2 bottom
- 15x Kailh Choc V2 switches

and 

- 1x printed top shell
- 1x printed bottom shell
- 1x printed top support plate
- 1x printed bottom support plate
- 2x printed menu button top
- 2x printed menu button bottom
- 1x Raspberry Pi Pico
- 12x m2 heat set inserts (I use Ruthex) (you can use more*)
- 5x 20mm m2 screws
- 3x 12mm m2 screws
- 5x 6mm m2 screws
- 2x 4mm m2 screws
- 4x m2 nuts
- 4x Kailh Silent switch for mice (or similarly sized substitutions)
- 1x 0,96 inch OLED SSD1306
- 1x female USB A breakout board. I got [these
  ones](https://www.amazon.de/Keenso-Breakout-Female-Adapter-Connector/dp/B07VBRTDVF) 
- a bunch of wire to connect everything (I use AWG 26 stranded wire but other wire will work the same)


Why "you can use more" than 12 heat set inserts? I've added more standoffs that can hold heat set
inserts in case you want extra safety. Mainly, they are there to support the
support plate without screws. I've found screws weren't needed in those
standoffs.

See notes on printing the components in [the printing
instructions](printing.md)

![Inside picture of the Em with the inner support plates being disconnected
from each other. Everything is printed in purple PLA. There is a raspberry pi
pico on the inside. A lot of green cables connected to the pico via soldering.
The green cables connect to the hot swap sockets for the switches. A couple of
black cables daisy chain the ground connection between the
switches.](pictures/inside-pic.jpeg "The assembled controller's insides")

## Planned changes
* add OLED-free variant
* improve printability

## Future features
* PCB version
