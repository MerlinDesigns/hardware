# Mini Arcade Button

This is a design for a mini arcade button for choc v1 switches with hotswap
sockets. It's 20.4 mm in diameter and 11.8 mm in height (with depressed
button).

It should be able to be screwed into the top plate of a controller.

Print with the following settings:
* layer height 0.1
* initial layer height 0.1
* detect thin walls
* 8 wall loops
* enable supports
* don't remove small overhangs

The button cap is based on [stokken's modular choc v1
caps](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/kailh-choc-v1-modular-keycaps).
