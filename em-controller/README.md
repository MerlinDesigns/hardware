# Em-Controller
The Em-controller is a hand-held all-button game controller. It's based around
a raspberry pi pico and running the amazing
[GP2040-CE](https://gp2040-ce.info/) firmware.

## Why this Form Factor?
The idea is to have something more like a game pad and the ability to laze
around on the couch while also having the benefits of a leverless controller.
 Like a flatbox without having to have the controller on the lap. While you
could just use a gamepad for this purpose, I have been unhappy with most, if
not all, dpads and wanted to be able to not miss the benefits of more detailed
control of directional input.

## How can I get my own?

**Note:** I'm still working on refining the details of version 1.0
This repository contains all information you need to print and assemble your
own.

The current version of this controller is handwired, so some soldering
equipment and skill is required.

### What you'll need
* 1 printed top shell
* 1 printed bottom shell
* 1 printed top support plate
* 1 printed bottom support plate
* 15 printed modular button caps 4.75mm high (based on [Stokken's great Kailh
  Choc V1 button
  caps](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/kailh-choc-v1-modular-keycaps)
* 15 printed button cap stems (from [Stokken's great Kailh
  Choc V1 button
  caps](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/kailh-choc-v1-modular-keycaps)
* 2 printed menu button top
* 2 printed menu button bottom
* 1 Raspberry Pi Pico
* at least 12 m2 heat set inserts (I use Ruthex)
* 4x 20mm m2 screws
* 3x 16mm m2 screws
* 2x 12mm m2 screws
* 5x 8mm m2 screws
* 2x m2 nuts
* 15 Kailh Choc v1 switches (I use
  5 [nocturnal](https://keycapsss.com/switchestester/switches/272/ambients-silent-choc-switches-lowprokb-kailh-choc-v1)
  and 10
  [Twilight](https://keycapsss.com/switchestester/switches/272/ambients-silent-choc-switches-lowprokb-kailh-choc-v1?number=KC10221_TWI)
  but any others like pink or reds will work)
* 4 Kailh Silent switch for mice (or similarly sized substitutions)
* a bunch of wire to connect everything (I use AWG 26 stranded wire but other
  wire will work the same)
* 0,96 inch OLED SSD1306

Why "at least" 12 heat set inserts? There are many more places to put heat set
inserts in case you want extra security. I've found they weren't needed.

## Near-future anticipated changes:
* improve README (more info, pictures, build information, installation)
* add OLED-free variant
* improve printability

## Future features
* PCB version
* RGB LEDs 
* Wireless?
* maybe analog sticks?
